# Sensitivity_RiskMeasures_epsilon_Neighbourhood
Investigates the variations of VaR, ES and expectile-quantile transformation level as the underlying distribution is in a epsilon-neighbourhood.
Obtains the approximations of risk measures by that by the pre-supposed ideal model, and the contamination heavier model due to the contamination level and the heaviness of contamination model
Illustrates the efficiency of variaty approximations by normal, Laplace and Power-like contamination models
Presents an empirical study on the CRIX with normal-Laplace contamination model
