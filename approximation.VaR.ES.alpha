Considers the epsilon-neighbourhood contamination models
Approximates the VaR, ES and the level ratio of expectile-quantile transformation by the heavier contamination model at scaled level
Plots the approximations to the true values via the level alpha
Finds the efficiency of approximations as alpha is close to zero
